<h1>SBA 308: JavaScript Fundamentals</h1>
<p>Create a script that gathers data, processes it, and then outputs a consistent result as described by a specification</p>
<ul>
  <li>Employ basic JavaScript syntax accurately.</li>
  <li>Implement control flow structures such as conditionals and loops effectively.</li>
  <li>>Use arrays and objects to organize and manage data.</li>
  <li>Develop functions to create reusable code.</li>
  <li>Utilize loops and iteration to navigate through data collections.</li>
  <li>Implement error handling to manage potential code failures gracefully.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Analyze and transform this data such that the output of your program is an array of objects, each containing the following information in the following format:</p>
<p>{<br>
    // the ID of the learner for which this data has been collected<br>
    <em>"id": number,</em><br>
    // the learnerâ€™s total, weighted average, in which assignments<br>
    // with more points_possible should be counted for more<br>
    // e.g. a learner with 50/100 on one assignment and 190/200 on another<br>
    // would have a weighted average score of 240/300 = 80%.<br>
    "avg": number,<br>
    // each assignment should have a key with its ID,<br>
    // and the value associated with it should be the percentage that<br>
    // the learner scored on the assignment (submission.score / points_possible)<br>
    <assignment_id>: number,<br>
    // if an assignment is not yet due, it should not be included in either<br>
    // the average or the keyed dictionary of scores<br>
}<br>
</p>
